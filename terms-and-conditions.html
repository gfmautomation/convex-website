                <h1>Terms and Conditions of Use – Convex</h1>
                <p>Last Updated: 23 January 2026</p>
                <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern the access to and use of the Convex AI contract-review platform ("Convex", "the Service"), operated by Convex Legal Pty Ltd (ABN 87 692 237 577) trading as Convex AI ("we", "our" or "us"). By creating an account, accessing the platform, or using the Service in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not accept these Terms, you must not use the Service.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="terms-content">
                <h2>A. Overview of the Service</h2>
                <p><strong>1.</strong> Convex is an AI-powered product designed to assist users with the review and analysis of property contracts and related documents. The Service uses artificial intelligence and supporting technologies to extract information, identify structural patterns, and generate automated summaries, reports and template-based outputs intended to assist conveyancers, lawyers and property professionals.</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> The Service is designed as a support tool only. Convex is not a legal practice, does not provide legal services, and is not a substitute for the skill, judgment or oversight of a lawyer or licensed conveyancer.</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Convex may be used by legal practitioners, conveyancers, real estate professionals, and other industry participants, as well as individuals seeking to better understand the contents of a property contract. However, the Service does not replace the need for informed professional review, nor does it create any solicitor-client relationship between you and Convex Legal Pty Ltd.</p>

                <h2>B. No Legal Advice</h2>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that Convex does not provide legal advice, legal representation or legal recommendations. Any output generated by the Service is produced automatically, based on the documents you upload and the system's programmed logic. Although the system has been designed with the expertise of legal practitioners, the outputs are generated by algorithms and should not be relied upon without independent professional assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>5.</strong> You remain solely responsible for reviewing, verifying and interpreting any report, analysis or summary produced by the platform. You must exercise your own professional judgment and ensure that any content you provide to clients, colleagues or third parties is accurate, complete and appropriate for its intended use.</p>
                <p><strong>6.</strong> Convex does not guarantee the legal adequacy of any output, and your reliance on the Service is entirely at your own risk.</p>

                <h2>C. User Accounts and Access</h2>
                <p><strong>7.</strong> To use Convex, you are required to create an account with accurate and up-to-date information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials, multi-factor authentication codes and any associated security measures. Any activity conducted through your account will be deemed to be authorised by you, and you must notify us immediately if you become aware of any unauthorised access or security breach.</p>
                <p><strong>8.</strong> We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if we consider it necessary to protect the integrity, security or lawful operation of the Service.</p>

                <h2>D. Data Handling and Processing</h2>
                <p><strong>9.</strong> By using the Service, you consent to Convex processing the documents and content you upload for the purpose of generating outputs, improving system reliability, and enhancing the accuracy and performance of the underlying models.</p>
                <p><strong>10.</strong> We do not use contract data to identify individuals or to create personal profiles. Instead, Convex analyses contract structures, clause patterns, metadata and contextual relationships within the uploaded material in a de-identified manner.</p>
                <p><strong>11.</strong> Convex does not store or use this information as personal data; it is evaluated solely for the purpose of assisting in contract review and for ongoing system improvement.</p>
                <p><strong>12.</strong> Uploaded documents may occasionally be accessed by authorised Convex personnel solely for debugging, troubleshooting or support purposes. Such access is limited, logged and controlled, and personnel are required to maintain confidentiality at all times.</p>

                <h2>E. Data Storage and Security</h2>
                <p><strong>13.</strong> Documents and data submitted to Convex are stored using Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 in the Sydney region. Access to stored data is controlled using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with appropriate authentication, authorisation and security configurations. AWS is widely recognised as an industry leader in secure cloud infrastructure and is relied upon by organisations operating in legal, financial, government and regulated environments.</p>
                <p><strong>14.</strong> Although we implement industry-standard security measures, no online platform can guarantee absolute security. By using Convex, you acknowledge that you upload and transmit data at your own risk, and you agree that you are responsible for maintaining your own backups and records of uploaded documents and outputs.</p>

                <h2>F. Data Retention</h2>
                <p><strong>15.</strong> Content uploaded to the Service is retained until you choose to delete it from your account. Convex does not assume responsibility for ensuring compliance with any professional, legal or regulatory retention obligations that may apply to you or your organisation.</p>
                <p><strong>16.</strong> If you are subject to document retention rules (including those applicable to lawyers and conveyancers), you must ensure that you maintain your own independent records and backups.</p>
                <p><strong>17.</strong> Convex does not guarantee archival storage, long-term preservation or retrieval of your documents beyond their presence within your account.</p>

                <h2>G. Fees, Credits and Payment</h2>
                <p><strong>18.</strong> Convex operates on a pay-per-contract pricing model. To review a contract, users must purchase credits in advance, with each contract review costing $29.73 (inclusive of GST). The Service will not process a contract review unless payment has been successfully made.</p>
                <p><strong>19.</strong> Upon creating an account, each new user receives 10 complimentary credits, which may be used in accordance with the functionality available on the platform.</p>
                
                <h2>H. MVP and Pilot Billing</h2>
                <p><strong>20.</strong> During any early access, pilot, beta or minimum viable product (MVP) phase (as determined by Convex), Convex may permit users to access paid features of the Service before payment is collected.</p>
                <p><strong>21.</strong> Where a user consumes contract reviews beyond their complimentary credits during such a phase, Convex may issue an invoice at the end of the relevant billing period (typically monthly) for the number of contract reviews used.</p>
                <p><strong>22.</strong> By continuing to use the Service beyond the complimentary credits, you authorise Convex to invoice you for such usage in accordance with the pricing disclosed on the platform or otherwise notified to you.</p>
                <p><strong>23.</strong> There are no setup fees, no minimum usage commitments and no subscription requirements. We may amend our pricing at any time, and any changes will apply to future purchases only.</p>

                <h2>I. Refunds and Australian Consumer Law</h2>
                <p><strong>24.</strong> To the extent permitted by the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), Convex does not offer refunds for change of mind or dissatisfaction with the style, format or content of any output.</p>
                <p><strong>25.</strong> Our goods and services come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the ACL. However, where permitted, our liability is limited to refunding the amount paid for the relevant service.</p>

                <h2>J. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
                <p><strong>26.</strong> You must use the Service lawfully and in accordance with these Terms. You must not upload documents that you are not legally entitled to share, nor may you use the platform to transmit malicious code, attempt to breach system security, or interfere with the proper functioning of the Service.</p>
                <p><strong>27.</strong> You must not attempt to reverse engineer, replicate, deconstruct or extract any part of Convex's system logic, prompts, workflow, architecture or proprietary processing methods. You must not attempt to translate outputs or interface structures into competing or derivative tools. Any behaviour that intentionally degrades, overloads or disrupts the Service is strictly prohibited.</p>

                <h2>K. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p><strong>28.</strong> All intellectual property rights in the Service, including the platform's architecture, software, algorithms, models, prompts, workflows, design elements, user interface, templates, documentation, trade dress and underlying technology, are owned exclusively by Convex Legal Pty Ltd. No licence or right is granted to you except to the extent necessary for you to use the Service strictly in accordance with these Terms.</p>
                <p><strong>29.</strong> You retain ownership of the documents you upload and of any outputs produced for your use. By uploading content, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive licence to process the content for the purpose of delivering the Service and improving system performance in de-identified form.</p>
                <p><strong>30.</strong> Any unauthorised use of Convex's intellectual property, including attempts to copy, adapt, commercialise or create derivative works, may result in termination of your account and potential legal action.</p>

                <h2>L. Availability and Performance</h2>
                <p><strong>31.</strong> The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. While we aim to maintain high levels of availability, we do not represent or warrant that access to the platform will be uninterrupted, free from errors, or secure from disruption.</p>
                <p><strong>32.</strong> System updates, improvements, outages, third-party issues or unforeseen events may affect availability. We reserve the right to modify, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time without liability.</p>

                <h2>M. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p><strong>33.</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, Convex excludes all liability for indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential loss, including loss of profits, loss of opportunity, loss of data, business interruption or reputational damage, whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise.</p>
                <p><strong>34.</strong> Convex is not responsible for errors or omissions in outputs, nor for any consequences arising from your reliance on them without appropriate professional review.</p>
                <p><strong>35.</strong> In all circumstances, our total liability to you for any claim arising out of or related to the Service is limited to the total amount paid by you for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. Nothing in these Terms limits any rights or remedies available to you under the ACL that cannot be lawfully excluded.</p>

                <h2>N. Indemnity</h2>
                <p><strong>36.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Convex Legal Pty Ltd, its directors, employees, contractors and affiliates from all claims, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including legal costs on a full indemnity basis) arising out of your misuse of the Service, your reliance on outputs without appropriate professional review, your breach of these Terms, or any content you upload.</p>

                <h2>O. Termination</h2>
                <p><strong>37.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if we consider that you have breached these Terms, misused the platform, compromised system integrity, or acted inconsistently with the intended use of the Service. You may cease using the Service at any time. Upon termination, we may retain your account information for administrative purposes, but you may request deletion of your uploaded documents in accordance with our data handling processes.</p>

                <h2>P. Amendments to Terms</h2>
                <p><strong>38.</strong> We may update or amend these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in the Service, legal obligations or business requirements. If material changes are made, we will endeavour to notify users through the platform or by email. Continued use of the Service following any update constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

                <h2>Q. Governing Law</h2>
                <p><strong>39.</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales, and you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that State for the resolution of any dispute arising in connection with the Service or these Terms.</p>

                <h2>R. Contact</h2>
                <p><strong>40.</strong> If you have any questions regarding these Terms, you may contact us through our online enquiry form, which can be accessed at: <a href="index.html#contact">Contact Us</a></p>

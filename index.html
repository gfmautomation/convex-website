                    <div class="faq-question">What is Convex and how does it help conveyancers?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Convex is an AI-powered platform that reviews property contracts and generates clear, client-ready output letters. It highlights key risks, flags unusual terms, and produces a structured report you can edit or send as is â€” helping you deliver higher quality reviews in less time.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Why should I use AI for contract reviews instead of doing everything manually?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Manual reviews are thorough but time-consuming. Convex speeds up the process by scanning the contract for common risks, ensuring you don't miss important issues, and preparing a client letter automatically â€” freeing up your time for advice and client interaction.
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How much time can Convex save me on a typical property contract review?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        On average, conveyancers report reducing review time by 30â€“50%, depending on the complexity of the contract. That means you can handle more matters per week without compromising quality.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Yes. By reducing the time spent on each review, you can take on more clients or offer additional premium services. Faster turnaround also improves client satisfaction and referrals.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Convex is designed to support, not replace, professional judgment. It uses advanced AI models trained on property law contracts to spot issues consistently. You remain in control, but the system reduces oversight and ensures nothing common is missed.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Convex analyses the contract, identifies risks, and generates a structured output letter for your client. The letter can be edited to match your style or sent directly, ensuring a professional and consistent review process.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        No. Convex is a review tool, not a drafting tool. It focuses on analysing existing contracts and creating a client-ready output letter summarising key points and risks.

                        When you use Convex, you are not just a general AI tool, but one specifically built to 
                        review property contracts. The tool has been developped by a team of software engineers, 
                        lawyers and conveyancers. The tool has been tested meticulously over thousands of contracts 
                        before its public debut to ensure the quality of the contract reviews is up to the standard 
                        of our team of lawyers and conveyancers. The tool also warns you of any tricky clauses through 
                        a quick and easy to understand traffic light system. This makes double checking a clause a breeze!

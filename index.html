                    <div class="faq-question">What is Convex and how does it work?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Convex is a legal-tech platform built specifically for NSW residential contract reviews. It combines AI, custom coding, and smart logic developed jointly between software engineers and an experienced property lawyer.<br><br>
                        Simply upload a contract and Convex instantly generates:<br>
                        • a traffic light report (green/amber/red) highlighting issues that require attention<br>
                        • a client-ready output letter you can edit or send<br>
                        • structured summaries that help you review faster and more consistently<br><br>
                        Convex doesn't replace your professional judgment — it fast-tracks the review process so you can focus on negotiations, advice, and exchange.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Why should I use AI for contract reviews instead of reviewing the contract manually?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Manual contract reviews are extremely time-consuming, especially with the low fixed fees charged in conveyancing. Clients also expect faster turnaround times than ever before.<br><br>
                        Convex helps you stay competitive by:<br>
                        • cutting review time dramatically<br>
                        • improving consistency and accuracy<br>
                        • helping you deliver reviews faster than competing firms<br>
                        • freeing you from repetitive scanning so you can focus on negotiations and client advice<br><br>
                        With the rapid rise of legal tech, firms that don't adopt efficient tools risk falling behind.

                    <div class="faq-question">How much time can Convex save me on a typical contract review?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Most conveyancers report a 30–50% reduction in review time. A review that normally takes 45–60 minutes might take 15–30 minutes with Convex. You can handle more clients per week without sacrificing quality - particularly during Friday rushes.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Yes. Contract reviews are often the most time-intensive stage of a conveyance. Convex helps you:<br>
                        • move through contract reviews faster<br>
                        • focus on negotiations and exchange<br>
                        • lock in deals sooner for your clients<br>
                        • take on more clients without increasing hours<br>
                        • deliver service levels that encourage referrals<br><br>
                        This directly increases your capacity and improves profitability.

                        Yes. Convex is highly accurate and continues to improve as we refine and enhance the system. It has been tested on thousands of NSW residential contracts and has an excellent success rate in identifying common and unusual risks.<br><br>
                        You still maintain full professional oversight - Convex is a tool designed to accelerate your review, not replace your legal judgment.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        No. Convex supports your review; it does not replace it. It reads the contract, flags issues, and drafts your client letter - but you perform the legal analysis, provide advice, and make decisions.

                        Convex is not a generic AI tool. It is a purpose-built review engine that combines:<br>
                        • AI<br>
                        • legal-specific coding<br>

                        • ongoing iteration and quality control<br><br>
                        It is built by a property lawyer, conveyancers, and software engineers working closely together to ensure accuracy and reliability.

                        • flagging risks<br>

                    <div class="faq-question">How does Convex decide whether a special condition is Green, Amber, or Red?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Convex uses an internal legal-logic classification system built from thousands of NSW residential property contracts, combined with AI and custom coding. Each special condition is assessed against a set of rules developed by an experienced property lawyer and refined through extensive testing.<br><br>
                        Here's how the classification works:<br>
                        🟢 Green – Standard or Low-Risk Conditions: These are clauses commonly seen in NSW residential contracts and usually pose no unusual risk to the buyer.<br><br>
                        🟡 Amber - Conditions Requiring Attention or Clarification: These clauses aren't necessarily problematic but differ slightly from standard practice, require explanation to the client, or may need negotiation depending on circumstances. Amber conditions prompt you to double-check before advising your client.<br><br>
                        🔴 Red - Unusual or High-Risk Conditions: These are flagged when a clause imposes obligations that may disadvantage the buyer, creates additional risk or liability, or requires legal clarification or negotiation. Red conditions are designed to immediately draw your attention to parts of the contract that typically warrant lawyer review or amendment.<br><br>
                        How the system works behind the scenes: Convex analyses each clause using legal-pattern recognition, risk-weighting algorithms, classification rules built from real NSW conveyancing experience, and ongoing user feedback and iterative improvements. The traffic light rating is not random - it is based on a deep library of contract conditions and how they behave in real-world conveyancing matters. As we continue improving Convex, the classification system becomes even more accurate over time.
